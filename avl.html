                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>AVL trees are another example of a self balancing tree. The rule to keep
                        in mind for these trees is that <b>the difference in height must be <br>
                        less than or equal to 1 (height&lt=1)</b>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AVL trees self-correct when this rule is violated, using rotations. In code,
                        this consists of redirecting pointers, which we will see later.
                    </p>

                <h2>Operations</h2>

                <h3>Insertion</h3>
                    <p>Following the insertion of a node into the correct spot in the tree, 
                        the tree must rebalance itself to maintian the proper height difference<br>
                        inside of the AVL tree. We do this by comparing the left and right of 
                        nodes beginning with the node just recently added. Below are examples:
                    </p>

                    <figcaption>Above, 23 is being added to the AVL tree. When it is initally placed,
                         it creates a height difference among nodes that is greater than one.<br>
                        To fix this, the tree self-corrects the balance by performing a left rotation.
                        This is because the imbalance occurs in the right child's right subtree of<br>
                        the node where the initial height difference greater than one, occurs.
                    </figcaption>
            
                <h3>Deletion</h3>
                    <p>Following the deletion of a node, find the first unbalanced node starting
                         at the spot at which the former node was removed. Travel up until the<br>
                         root is reached. Any difference in height greater than 1 results in the 
                         tree being rebalancd. Below are some other examples:
