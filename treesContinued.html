            <h2>Traversals</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, you will want to traverse and visit every node in the tree. 
                This will take O(n) time.<br> 
                Trees can be traversed through four different orders:<br>
                Level-Order, In-Order, Pre-Order, Post-Order
            </p>
            <div id = "Level-Order">
            <h3>Level-Order Pseudocode</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin a queue with the root node</li>
                    <li>Enqueue its children from left to right</li>
                    <li>Dequeue the next node in line and process it</li>
                    <li>Repeat until no nodes remain in queue</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Rotations</h2>
            <p>The purpose of rotations is to keep a tree balanced. We will explore
            4 different kinds of rotations: right, left, right-left, and left-right.</p>
            <p>Imbalances occur when nodes are inserted and deleted from the tree.
                We will treat the node that tips the balance as the child node.<br>
                Rotations alter the positioning of the child, parent, and grandparent nodes.

            </p>

                <h2>Rotations Explained</h2>
                <div id = "right-rotation">
                    <h3>Right Rotation</h3>
                    <img src = "\images\right-rotate img.jpg" alt = "right-rotation image">

                    <p>When a tree is imbalanced on its left child, left subtree, we can perform a right-rotation by<br>
                        making the grandparent node the right child of the parent node. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id = "left-rotation">
                    <h3>Left Rotation</h3>
                    <img src = "\images\left-rotate img.jpg" alt = "left-rotation image">
                    <p>When a tree is imbalanced on its right child, right subtree, we perform a left-rotation by <br>
                      making the grandparent node the left child of the parent node.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Complex rotations</h3>
                <p>Often, a rotation won't be so simple as changing the pointers of the parent and grandparent nodes<br>
                   We can perform different rotations when the imbalance is less obvious. Rotations sometimes must be <br>
                   chained to ensure that the final product is a optimally balanced tree.
                </p>
                <h3>Right-Left Rotation</h3>
                <img src = "\images\right-left img.jpg" alt = "right-left rotation">
                <p>Here the tree is imbalanced on the grandparent's right child, left subtree. We rotate<br>
                by first making the leaf node the new child of the grandparent, and the leaf's right child the former<br>
                parent. This creates a structure for a trivial left rotation.
                </p>
                <h3>Left-Right Rotation</h3>
                <img src = "images/left-right img.jpg" alt = "left-right rotation">
                <p>In this example the tree is imbalanced on the grandparent's left child, right subtree. We rotate<br>
                    by first making the leaf node the new child of the grandparent, and the leaf's left child the former<br>
                    parent. This creates a structure for a trivial right rotation.
