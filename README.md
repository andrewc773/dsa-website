# dsa-website
This is my first project. The purpose of creating this website is to teach data structures. It includes a detailed description
of each type of structure, images intended to demonstrate how they operate, and supplementary code that will help a student 
deepen their understanding.

I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
