        <h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>
        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        
        <p>Binary search trees are tree structures that order their nodes. A node whose key
            greater than the key of the node it is being compared to would belong to the <br>
            right of the compared node, and if the key is less than the compared node's key, 
            it would go to the left. 
        </p>

        <div id = "pros-cons">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>Binary search trees have a faster average time complexity than their list counterparts.
            Assuming a tree is balanced, operations generally take O(log n) time compared to <br>
            lists or arrays that have a log(n) average time complexity.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Balanced search trees have an average search, deletion, and insertion time of O(log n)</li>
            <li>The keys to our node are in sorted order, and can be accessed in multiple ways
                depending on the traversal order you implement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <li>The benefits of the binary search tree over structures such as linked lists and arrays 
            are primarily assuming the tree is balanced. Unbalanced trees are similar in function<br>
            and algorithmic cost to a linked list.
        </li>
        <li>Binary search trees by themselves have no mechanism to self-correct any unbalancing
            that can occur from inserting or deleting nodes. This makes it unlikely for the tree<br>
            to perform at its optimized time complexity after several insertion or deletions.
        </li>
