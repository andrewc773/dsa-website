                Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. - Linus Torvalds

        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
        <p><i>Data Structures: An Introduction</i> is designed to teach its members fundamental data structures 
        that are commonly seen in the vastly-expanding world of computer science and technology. By providing<br>
        simple visuals and explanations of data structures, we hope to deepen understanding enough so one may 
        be able to implement these structures in their computer science endeavors. The information taught on<br>
        this site can aid for coding interviews, school coursework and exams, and personal projects. </p>

        <h2>Who is this website for?</h2>
        <p>Anyone who is eager to become a better computer scientist! The information taught can greatly aid 
            students in university, job seekers preparing for interviews, or the curious mind who wants to <br>
            understand how computers are able to store and manipulate vast amounts of data in an efficient manner.
        </p>

        <h2>How can one gain the most from this website?</h2>
        <p>The best way to learn these structures is to study the material, and then try to implement it for
            yourself. Create scenarios where data needs to be stored, and pick the most suitable data structure<br>
            for the situation. Project-based learning is paramount to gaining deep understanding on initially 
            complex topics. The code provided is meant to aid you in seeing how the structures operate. Blindly<br>
            copying them will only impede your potential to truly get how the structures function.
