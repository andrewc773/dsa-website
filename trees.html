                <p>In computer science, a binary digit is the smallest unit of data for 
                    computing. Binary means that there are only two options: 0 or 1,<br>
                    on or off, left or right, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Binary trees are data structures that store data in a way that
                    forms a tree-like formation. Each node is connected via an edge.<br>
                    General binary trees do not need to have any specific order to them, 
                    but as we will see in later tree-structures, order is very important<br>
                    to have a structure that can retrieve and store data efficiently.

                    Each tree consists of nodes that represent a part of that tree. Nodes that have other nodes 
                    stemming from them are known as parents,<br> and their
                    descendant nodes are called child nodes. Nodes who have no children are known as leaf nodes. 
                    The node that begins the tree,<br> where all other trees
                    ultimately derive from, is the root node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any subspace of the tree is known as the subtree. The height of the tree is the number of edges 
                    from the root to the deepest node down the tree.<br>
                    tree with only the root has a height of zero. The diagram above demonstrates these features.

                <h3>Balanced Tree</h3>
                <p>For a tree to function as a structure with optimal algorithmic cost, 
                it must be balanced. Balanced trees have an even distribution of<br>
                across the left and right sides. Below is a demonstration of a balanced binary search 
                tree performing at an optimized cost. We will explore how to balance a tree in <br>
                future implementations of trees.

                <h3>Complete Tree</h3>
                <p>Complete trees are trees whose levels are all filled at the maximum 
                    capacity with two children. The only parent nodes with less than two children should<br>
                    be the last level, and the child nodes must be aligned to the left.

                <h3>Full Tree</h3>
                <p>Full trees are trees with all nodes having zero or two children.

                <p>
                    In optimal conditions, when a tree is balanced, search, insertion, and deletion
                    time can average an <b>O(log n)</b> time. This is due to the nature of the tree's<br>
                    structure. Every level you step down in the tree eliminates the half of the tree 
                    that you did not traverse. For example, starting from the root node, if you <br>
                    traverse to the right child, you eliminate the left subtree from your choices.
                    Cutting in half continuosly scales to a log2 n complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unbalanced trees can make performance suffer. A <b>degenerate tree</b> for example,
                    is a tree where every parent node has only one child node. This results in a structure<br>
                    similar to a linked list, and will perform to a worst-case of O(n) time.
