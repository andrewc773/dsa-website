            <h2 id = "definition">What are they?</h2>
            <p>An array is a collection of elements, usually of the same data type
                (such as an integer or string), that is put together in a list-fashion.<br>
                Each element has its own spot in the list, which can be accessed directly
                in O(1) time if the index is known beforehand.<br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = "array-img" style="margin-right: -80px">
            <img src = "/images/array demo.jpeg">;
        </div>
    </header>

    <div id = "pros-cons" class ="middle" >
        <h2 id = "advantages">The Advantages</h2>
        <p>With an array, you can access any spot in it in O(1) time. 
            Whether you are looking for an element in the front or back<br>
            list does not matter in terms of time complexity.
        </p>
        <p>  
            If an element is known before hand, you can find it immediately
            Arrays make it easy and simple to access data, especially
            if they are of the same type.
        </p>   
        <p>
            Arrays can also provide a container for all related data, 
            which makes for better organization.
        </p>

        <h2 id = "disadvantages">The Disadvantages</h2>
        <p>Arrays are a fixed-length data structure. Their size
            must be set upon initializtion, which can be incovenient<br>
            if the number of elements coming in is unknown or ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>An array's elements are stored in sequential memory locations,
            making insertion and deletion difficult as the target approaches<br>
            the middle of the array.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another disadvantage is their inefficieny in checking for a particular
            element whose index in unknown. In order to find an element this way,
            one <br> must traverse the entire list from the beginning (assuming the
            array is unsorted). The search time has a potential O(n) time.
