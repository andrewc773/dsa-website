    <h1>Stacks</h1>
    <div id = "definition">
        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <p>
            Stacks are an abstract data type that orders a collection of items linearly.
            It operates in a "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) manner. <br>
            A good way to think about it is to imagine a standard canister for tennis balls.
            The ball at the bottom of the canister was added first, <br> and the first one
            to be popped out is the ball that was last inserted.
        </p>
        <img src = "images/stack-demo.jpg" alt = "stack img">
        <p>Stack architecture is commonly used for holding the order of webpages you visit,
            several backtracking algorithms,<br> and any situation where you want to retrieve
            data in the reverse order that you put them in.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div id = "operations-sec">
        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>Stacks have three main, distinct operations: <i>push</i>, <i>pop</i>
            and <i>peek</i>.</p>
        <h3>Push</h3>
        <p>Pushing something into the stack is the method to add another element to it.
            Recall the tennis ball canister analogy; to <i>push</i> a ball into it<br>
            would be to add one more to the container.
        </p>
        <h3>Pop</h3>
        <p>Popping something out of the stack is the operation to remove the last
            element added to it. Just like a tennis ball container, popping a ball<br>
            out is how you remove one.
        </p>
        <h3>Peek</h3>
        <p>Peek allows one to view the last element inserted into the stack without 
            removing it from the collection.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id = "pros-cons">
        <h2>The Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ideal if retrieval of data in reverse order of insertion is the goal</li>
            <li>Allows control of how memory is assigned</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>The Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random access is not a feature of the data stucture</li>
            <li>Too many objects can lead to a stack overflow</li>
            <li>Can run out of memory very fast</li>
        </ul>
