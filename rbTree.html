        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <p>
            Red-Black trees are a special kind of self-balancing tree. The nodes
            contain an extra bit of information- their color: red or black. <br>
            In order to remain balanced, the tree has several rules it follows to
            maintain itself, which it decides based on the color of the nodes.
        </p>

        <h3>The Rules</h3>
        <ol id = "rb-tree-rules">
            <li>The root must be black</li>
            <li>Children of red nodes are black</li>
            <li>All external nodes share the same black depth</li>
            <li>New nodes being inserted are always initially red</li>
            <li>No path can have two or more consecutive red nodes</li>
            <li>Null nodes are always considered black</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Re-balancing</h2>
        <p>Red-Black trees self-balance by two mechanisms: color-flipping and 
            rotations. <br><br>If the sibling of the new node's parent is:
            <ul>
             <li>black, rotate the tree. The colors should be reset so the parent is black and children are red.</li>
             <li>red, color-flip. The new node's grandparent node is flipped, as well as
                 both of its children (one of these children is the new node's parent).<br>
             </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Color-flipping</h3>
        <img src = "rb-colorflip.jpg" alt = "basic color-flip image">
        <h3>Rotation</h3>
        <p>Rotation occurs at the imbalanced part of the tree. Here are two examples:</p>

    <div id = "performance">
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>Red-Black Trees on average perform at an O(log n) algorithmic
            complexity. Given that they are self-balancing, one can<br>
            assume they are always working at an optimized level.

    <div id = "pros-cons">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul id = advantage-list>
            <li>Self-rotating tree that allows for optimized peformance</li>
            <li>Useful when there is a lot of data being added and removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul id = "disadvantage-list">
            <li>B-trees are better for indexing and storing info on a disk</li>
            <li>Implementation can be complicated; there are several differing
                operations for edge cases.
            </li>
