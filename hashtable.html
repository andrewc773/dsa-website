                <h2>What are they?</h2>
                    <p>A hash table is a data structure that can map a key to a value in 
                    an array-like structure, using a hash function.<br>It is highly 
                    efficient for adding, removing, and retrieving data because of its
                    key-value pair system.
                    </p>

            <div class="ds-sect" id="miscellaneous">
                <h2>Hashing Function</h2>
                <p>The job of the hash function is to generate a unique index
                with a provided key, and the value will be stored at this index.<br>
                It is important that the function creates a <b>hash code</b> that is 
                usually unique- this minimizes collisions which can slow down the 
                operations of the table.<br>The hash code is then compressed to fit into the range
                of indices of the table. 
                </p>
            <h2>Hash Collisions</h2>
            <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <p>Hash collisions occur when two distinct keys are mapped to the same spot in the 
                hash table. <br>This happens when the generated hash codes are compressed.
                </p>
            <h3>How are they handled?</h3>
                <p>Hash collisions can be handled using two different approaches:<br>
                    <i>open addressing</i> and <i>separate chaining</i>.</p>
            <h3>Open Addressing</h3>
            
            <p>When a value is being mapped to an index that already exists, we can
                check if any nearby indices are empty so we can place it there instead.<br>
                Checking for empty spots in increments of one is known as <b>linear probing</b>
                and squaring the increments (k+1, k+4, k+9, etc) is <b>quadratic probing</b>.
            </p>
            <img src = "images/linear-probing.jpg" alt = "linear-probing img">
            <h4>Issues with probing</h4>
                <p>One issue with using probing is that it can lead to <b>clustering</b>.
                This is when a particular range of the table is cluttered with many <br>
                taken spots. This can cause future probing to take much longer, since
                a longer traversal is made each time to keep finding an empty spot.</p>
                <img src = "images/clustered-img.jpg" alt = "img of clustered table">
            <h3>Separate chaining</h3>
            <p>Here, we scrap the idea of checking for nearby empty spots. Instead, we treat
                each index as a bucket that can store multiple different values.<br>The bucket
                can be any data structure that such as a linked list or sorted tree. When
                a value is being mapped to an index, it is added to the index's bucket.<br>
                Using a linked list example, this would meaning adding another node to the linked
                list containing the new value.
            </p>

                <h2>Performance</h2>
                <p>Hashtables can perform insertion, deletion, and searching at O(1) time, 
                    making them an optimal solution for many problems in computer science.<br>
                    
                    They have the advantage of easy access anywhere just like with arrays, but on top of that,
                    its contents are quickly found if one knows the key.
